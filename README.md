# Real Life Violence Situations Dataset Video Classification

This project aims to develop a video classification model capable of accurately distinguishing between violence and non-violence video samples using the Real Life Violence Situations Dataset.

## Dataset

The Real Life Violence Situations Dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset/data). It contains video samples of real-life violence situations along with non-violence video samples.

## Implementation

The implementation is done using a notebook on Google Colab for model training. The notebook utilizes a MobileNet LSTM model architecture for video classification. Due to potential memory constraints, a smaller subset of the dataset may be used for training.

## Methodology

We advocate for the utilization of simple, computationally efficient, and problem-specific methodologies. The MobileNet LSTM model is chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling video classification tasks.

## Results

After training the MobileNet LSTM model on the dataset, we achieved up to 99% accuracy on the classification task.
##Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics, along with considerations for simplicity, standardization, and coding style.

##Feedback

Feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements or would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
