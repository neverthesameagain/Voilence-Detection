# Fight Scene Detection for Movie Highlight Generation System

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Fight Scene Detection (FSD) model used for generating highlights from movies. The system utilizes deep learning techniques, particularly Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, to automatically identify fight scenes in movies and compile them into captivating highlights.

## Introduction
In the era of AI-driven automation, this project addresses the need for efficient and reliable solutions in generating movie highlights, particularly focusing on identifying fight scenes. The system streamlines the process of highlight generation by automating the identification and compilation of fight scenes, reducing manual effort and enhancing the quality and consistency of the generated highlights.

## Features
- Fight Scene Detection (FSD) model based on BiLSTM networks.
- Automated compilation of fight scenes into movie highlights.
- User-friendly GUI for uploading videos and generating highlights.
- Performance metrics evaluation and visualization.
- Integration with Gradio for hosting the GUI as an API.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fight-scene-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fight-scene-detection
   ```

2. Run the GUI interface:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

3. Upload a video file using the GUI and generate the highlights.

## Results
The FSD model achieves an accuracy of 93.5% in identifying fight scenes in movies. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated and visualized for further analysis. The generated highlights provide users with a concise compilation of fight scenes from the input video.
